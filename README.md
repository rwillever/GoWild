# Frontier Airlines GoWild Pass - scraper program

This PC executable program will allow a user to enter flight information and see if Frontier GoWild Seats are available.
The program was initially written by fly-metothemoon and I added to it. He is way more of a programmer than I am.


when you run the program, it will prompt like this

Enter Originating City (3 letter abbreviation) - phl

Enter Destination City - cun

Enter Starting Date (format m/d/yy) - 7/8/23

Enter End Date (format m/d/yy) - 7/12/23

Non stop only  (0 = no, 1 = yes) - 1

Show Return Flights  (0 = no, 1 = yes) - 1
